# object-descriptor
This is the folder with the code to repeat the experiments presented in the paper.


*NOTE*: this code will be later cleaned up for easier work. For now, the first version is presented here. Please ping me at _dmytro(dot)bobkov(at)tum(dot)de_ in case you are interested.

We defined dataset constants (folder path where the dataset is stored in dataset_constants.py).

The network itself is defined in nn_models.py. See wrapper for the way to run the network on different datasets. This requires the pre-computed descriptor at a certain point (code for this is not available yet as it requires some cleaning).
